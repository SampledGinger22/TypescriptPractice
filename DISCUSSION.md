Thank you for putting this test together! It was a ton of fun, regardless of where this ends.

With additional time there were a few things I wanted to do.

Design:
- Make the header and background more appealing. A basic white background with blocky font was really not appealing, but I wanted to at least attempt the db integration. I would have liked to center the header in a row with the search container a bit closer to the table.
- The search form was a decent success, but the way that the word "Search" sits above the actual box felt odd. I also think the reset search button was a bit too prominent and could have been made smaller, plainer, and just held the word "clear" or "reset."
- Replace the table with card results. Tables are fine, but they leave me feeling like I could have used excel and its always a bit graphically disappointing. Cards can render info a bit more dynamically and it would have made the height of each result less controlled by the list of specialties. 

Backend:
- Obviously, I would have finished connecting the GET call to the db so I could load all results quickly. I think I was close (I hope), and I may finish it on my own time just to see how it all connects. I've never used docker or postgres so it was a fun challenge.
